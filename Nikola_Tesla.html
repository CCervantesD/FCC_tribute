		Nikola Tesla was born on July 10 1856, Smiljan, Austrian Empire.
			His father was an Orthodox priest; his mother was unschooled but highly intelligent.
			He always displayed a remarkable imagination and creativity.
			Interested on an engeneering carrer he attended to the Technical University at Graz, Austria and University of Prage. 
			At Graz he saw the Gramme dynamo that when reversed became an electric motor and cocnceived a way to use alternating current to advantage. 
			It was on Budapest when he visualized the principle of the rotating magnetic field, he develop plans to create an induction motor wich was the first step for the successful utilization of alternating current.

        	<h3>1882</h3>
			Tesla worked in Paris at Continental Edison Company where after hours he build his first indution motor.
			<h3>1884</h3>
			He arrived to America and started working with Thomas Edison but their methods and backgrouds where way to different and the separation was inevitable.
			<h3>1888</h3>
			George Westinghouse bought Tesla's patent of the polyphase system of alternating-current dynamos, transformers, and motors. This transactio begun the struggle between Thomas Edison direct-current and Tesla-Westinghouse alternating-current approach, wich eventaully won.
			To allay fears about alternating-current he gave exhibitions in his laboratory in which he lit lamps by allowing electricity to flow through his body.
			<h3>1893</h3>
			This was a great year for Tesla, Westinghouse used Tesla’s alternating current system to light the World’s Columbian Exposition at Chicago and this was a factor in winning the contract to install the first power machinery at Niagara Falls, which bore Tesla’s name and patent numbers. The project carried power to Buffalo by 1896.
			<h3>1899-1900</h3>
			He made his most impirtant discovery in Colorado Springs, terrestrial stationary waves.he proved that Earth could be used as a conductor and made to resonate at a certain electrical frequency. He also lit 200 lamps without wires from a distance of 40 km (25 miles) and created man-made lightning, producing flashes measuring 41 metres (135 feet)
			<h3>1900</h3>
			Back in New York, Tesla begun the construction of a wireless world broadcasting tower, with $150,000 capital from the American financier J. Pierpont Morgan. He was expecting to provide worldwide comunication but the project was abandon because of a financial panic and Morgan's withdrawl of support. It was a great defeat for Tesla.
			He shift to turbines and other project but because of the lack of funds his ideas remained in his notebooks, which are still examined by enthusiasts.
            </p>
			<p>He died on January 7, 1943 but his achivements will always remain with us.</p>
